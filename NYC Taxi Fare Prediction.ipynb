    "\n",
    "In this project, we \"enter\" a Kaggle competition to build a model to predict NYC taxi fares. The competition expired so we can't formally submit and show our scores so here we select a subset of training data and build an ensemble model to predict the fare. This is a regression problem so our performance is measured in RMSE, or root mean-squared error. We take the differences between our predictions and the actual fares and square root of the square of this value. Taking the square of the error provides more insight than the absolute value of difference because it provides more penalty to estimates with larger error and rewards estimates with smaller error. The features provided in the training data proved to be very poor predictors of taxi fare so we had to engineer our own features. We used several distance features because distance is the predominant driver of fare prices, all of which were calculated from pickup and dropoff GPS coordinates, along with identifying airports as hotspots for more expensive fares. \n",

    "One of the most decisive factors in deciding which features to include in training our models is the feature correlation matrix. This matrix computes the covariances between every feature in our training data and then normalizes it to a coefficient between +1 and -1. +1 indicates a strong linear relationship, where one feature moves the other feature moves at exactly the same slope. A value of 0 indicates no relationship and a value of -1 indicates a polar opposite relationship. We explored to see if there was any correlation between taxi fares from transit hubs and found that there is a correlation coefficient of 0.25 between airports and taxi fares. We tried this same approach with Port Authority, Penn Station, and Grand Central but none had any positive impact on performance."

    "\n",
    "Here we drop records with missing entries along with other weakly correlated features that don't improve our model. We chose over a dozen Scikit  regression models but none proved to be nearly as effective as XGBoost. It gave us a best RMSE of 3.4976 on the test data while no other models scored less than 5. XGBoost is an ensemble method which has been dominating machine learning algorithm performance and is frequently the best performer in Kaggle competitions. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting, uses a gradient boosted ensemble decision tree method that trains many learners with the ultimate prediction being the prediction the most learners selected. It trades off \"frills\" and extra features and is focused almost exclusively on speed and performance. \n",
